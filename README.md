# Web-based Ground Control Station
[![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPL--3.0-brightgreen)](https://github.com/lyuyangh/cloud-station/blob/master/LICENSE)  
The goal of this project is to develop a cloud-based ground control station for Ardupilot drones. The web app is designed to be easily scalable so users can control multiple drones at the same time.   

The project is still under development and we would love to have more developers joining us!
