# Web-based Ground Control Station
[![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPL--3.0-brightgreen)](https://github.com/lyuyangh/cloud-station/blob/master/LICENSE)  
The goal of this project is to develop a cloud-based ground control station for Ardupilot drones. The web app is designed to be easily scalable so users can control multiple drones at the same time.   
> The project is still under development and we would love to have more developers joining us!

## Prerequisite 
```
Python 3.6+
Django
Django Channels
Django Background Tasks
Redis
pyMavlink
pyserial
Docker
```
> Tutorial to setup Python Django development environment: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/development_environment

## Getting started
**These steps can be used to set up a local development environment for this web app. Please follow deployment instructions instead if you want to deploy it on a web server.**
  1. Install libraries    
      ```
      pip3 install -r requirements.txt  
      ```
  2. Install and run docker: https://www.docker.com/get-started
      ```  
      docker run -p 6379:6379 -d redis:2.8
      ```
  3. Register for MapBox and generate a public access token https://account.mapbox.com/
  4. Add mapbox public access token (public key) to .env of your environment
    Note: Please do not push your pk to GitHub. In production env, this key should ideally
    be temporary and change from session to session.      
        * ubuntu   
        ```export MAPBOX_PUBLIC_KEY=pk.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx```     
        * windows  
        ```setx MAPBOX_PUBLIC_KEY "pk.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"``` or add an entry in system variables
        
### Run server
```
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
python3 manage.py runserver
python3 manage.py process_tasks
```
